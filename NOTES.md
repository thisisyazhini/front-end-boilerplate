## What's implemented

- Overview and detail pages for Pokemon and Rick&Morty
- Implemented View and Grid display modes for Pokemon and Rick&Morty
- Data fetching is done through API party
- Pinia store is used for storing Rick and Morty character data
  - Decided to implement the store for only Rick and morty character data already contains the details of each character, which is not the case for Pokemon
- Used components from NuxtUI where applicable
- Created reusable dumb components to avoid code redundancy
- Didn't delete the boilerplate code. But modified it where necessary
